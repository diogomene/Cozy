# Cozy

## What is it?
Cozy is a project that i've been developing to be a simple PWA book reader and organizer

## How to use it?
My idea is to finish it's development and publish it on Netlify. Once launched, anybody will be able to use itnin your own computer, cellphone, tablet, etc, even when there is no internet.

## Future steps:
- [ ] Fix some strange mistakes on ServiceWorker (offline fallback conditions)
- [ ] Finish the application stylization
- [ ] Develop an easy way to add new books and rate them
- [ ] Develop a user-friendly reading UI
- [ ] Integrate it with some native functionalities that may help the users to read their books
- [ ] Think about adding a statistic page, showing some reading info, like pages read by day, lifetime pages read by the user, etc...
- [ ] Think about devolop a good dark-mode, or a responsible color theme, that may attend to the user's system preferences

## Can i use the code?
Absolutely. This project's code is entirely free-to-use. No needs to reference, or asking for permissions of any nature
